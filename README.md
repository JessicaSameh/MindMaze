# MIINDMAZE
Welcome to our Arduino-based game designed specifically for neurologists to assess their patients' memory capabilities. With two distinct modes tailored to challenge different aspects of memory function, this game offers a comprehensive and interactive tool for evaluating cognitive skills.

Mode 1: Reaction Time Test

In Mode 1, prepare to put your reflexes to the test as you face a series of randomly lit LEDs. Each LED represents a different color - red, green, blue, or yellow. Your task is to swiftly press the corresponding button as each LED lights up. The game measures your response time, calculating The average time you take to react to 5 illuminated LEDs in each round.

Mode 2: Memory Game

Switching gears to Mode 2, Patients encounter a sequence of LEDs lighting up in various colors. They should Pay close attention as the LEDs illuminate one after the other, with each color appearing a random number of times. Once the sequence concludes, it's their turn to recall the number of LEDs they saw for a randomly selected color. Using the keypad to input their answer and then wait for their score appearing in the LCD.
